Welcome to Paranoia!

HOW TO PLAY:
   Just press <Enter> until you are asked to make a choice.
   Select 'a' or 'b' or whatever for your choice, then press <Enter>.
   You may select 'p' at any time to get a display of your statistics.
   Always choose the least dangerous option.  Continue doing this until
   you win. At times you will use a skill or engage in combat and will
   be informed of the outcome.  These sections will be self explanatory.

HOW TO DIE:
   As Philo-R-DMD you will die at times during the adventure.
   When this happens you will be given a new clone at a particular
   location. The new Philo-R will usually have to retrace some of
   the old Philo-R's path, but hopefully he won't make the same mistake
   as his predecessor.

HOW TO WIN:
   Simply complete the mission before you expend all six clones.
   If you make it, congratulations.
   If not, you can try again later.

gifts make one a more valuable member, and thus did the Retailers come to

The planned takeover of the Troubleshooter Training Course goes well, Comrade.
Once we have trained the unwitting bourgeois troubleshooters to work as
communist dupes, the overthrow of Alpha Complex will be unstoppable.  My survey
of the complex has convinced me that no one suspects a thing soon it will be
too late for them to oppose the revolution.  The only thing that could possibly
impede the people's revolution would be someone alerting The Computer to our
plans (for instance, some enterprising Troubleshooter could tell The Computer
that the communists have liberated the Troubleshooter Training Course and plan
to use it as a jumping off point from which to undermine the stability of all
Alpha Complex), but as we both know, the capitalistic Troubleshooters would
never serve the interests of the proletariat above their own bourgeois desires.
